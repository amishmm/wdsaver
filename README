Compiling:
----------
run:
  make
   OR
  cc wdsaver.c -o wdsaver

Usage:
------
Run:
  ./wdsaver -h

Testing: (as root)
--------
(assuming defaults parameters being used)
1) Select timeout say 40 seconds
2) Do a test (non-live mode) run:
   ./wdsaver -t 40 -v
3) Check the output i.e. functioning of program
4) Once satisfied, put in live mode and test again:
   ./wdsaver -t 40 -v -l
5) Check the output i.e. functioning of program

TIP:
----
For 'random read' method (see usage), if your most active partition
on the drive is /dev/sda3 (say /home or just /) then it would be
nice idea to specify it as a device (-d option) to read from.

That should reduce head movement away from the active partition.

Installing: (as root)
-----------
1) Once satisfied with testing, run
   make install
    OR
   copy the file to /usr/bin
   cp -i ./wdsaver /usr/bin; chmod 700 /usr/bin/wdsaver
2) Put the following in rc.local of your system startup:
   /usr/bin/wdsaver -t 40 -l -b


Enjoy, the safety of your drive and drive safely!
